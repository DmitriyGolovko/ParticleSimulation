This is going to be another somewhat ambitious project.
The premise is a particle simulation.
With 3 forces: Gravity, Magnetic, and Electric

The goal is to study how a rotating system of charged particles creates a magnetic field.

Some questions to ask:
-Do the charges of the particles affect the final shape of a settled system of particles?
-How does the rotation of the shape affect its motion/shape?
-How far can a simulation be pushed on a web browser?

---------------------------------
Design:

ToDo
A basic outline of the steps required to complete the proejct.
These steps could change depending on what is discovered during research.

1. Design basic UI to accomodate parameters.


2. Create the server for handling requests.


3. Implement basic 3D graphics for particles.


4. Plan implementation of physics equations - long term.


5. Implement particle simulation physics with gravity and electric force (instantaneous forces).


6. Multithread the simulation using dedicated workers.


7. Simulate using delayed forces accounting for speed of light of information relay.
