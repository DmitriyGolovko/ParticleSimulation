---------------TASKS-------------
-Add error handling for programShaders. DONE
-Adjust opengl window on resize. DONE



----------------GOAL-----------------

This is going to be another somewhat ambitious project.
The premise is a particle simulation.
With 3 forces: Gravity, Magnetic, and Electric

The goal is to study how a rotating system of charged particles creates a magnetic field.

Some questions to ask:
-Do the charges of the particles affect the final shape of a settled system of particles?
-How does the rotation of the shape affect its motion/shape?
-How far can a simulation be pushed on a web browser?

--------------Design---------------

Features:
-Dedicated workers for parallel processing.
-Post processing effects for better visuals.

UI Parameters:
-Pause/play
-Simulation speed slider

-Selection delete

-Brush on/off
-Brush size
-Brush shape

(Brush parameters window)
-Particle initial velocities
-Particle masses distribution
-Particle charge distribution

(Simulaition parameters window)
-Gravity strength

-Help info window

-------------REMINDERS--------------------
-Webgl context parameters. Event loop?


-------------MAIN OUTLINE------------------
ToDo
A basic outline of the steps required to complete the project.
These steps could change depending on what is discovered during research.

1. Design basic UI to accomodate parameters.
-Created basic functionality of buttons. Will beautify later.
-Will create windows for parameters and help later.

2. Create the server for handling requests.
-Copied the central server setup.
-Will make it harder to work on multiple stations but may not need to the next 20 days.

3. Implement basic 3D graphics for particles.
-Create perspective and camera transformations for the vertex shader.


4. Plan implementation of physics equations - long term.


5. Implement particle simulation physics with gravity and electric force (instantaneous forces).


6. Multithread the simulation using dedicated workers.


7. Simulate using delayed forces accounting for speed of light of information relay.
