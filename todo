This is going to be another somewhat ambitious project.
The premise is a particle simulation.
With 3 forces: Gravity, Magnetic, and Electric

The goal is to study how a rotating system of charged particles creates a magnetic field.

Some questions to ask:
-Do the charges of the particles affect the final shape of a settled system of particles?
-How does the rotation of the shape affect its motion/shape?
-How far can a simulation be pushed on a web browser?


Design:
-Dedicated workers for parallel processing.
-Post processing effects for better visuals.
